Example
  -database mining
  -application (NLP , handwriting recognition)
  -self-customizing programs
    Amazon ,Netflix
  - understanding human learning
task = T
performance = P
Experience =E

Eg.Suppose your email program watches which emails you do or do not mark as spam, 
and based on that learns how to better filter spam. What is the task T in this setting?

T = Classify emails as spam or not spam
P = the number of emails correctly classified as spam
E = Watching you label emails as spam or not spam

Supervised Learning
-Classification
-Regression

"right answers" given
product more right answer
Example . Housing price prediction

1.Classification 
like, zero game  (0/1)
0 - No
1-Yes
eg. Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.

2.Regression
continuous number of case
depand on different feature
use for predection
eg. Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture

Unsupervised Learning 
clustering different item by given data
applycation 
  -Organize computing cluster
  -Social network analysis
  -Market segmentation
  cluster different type of coustomers
  -Astronmical data analysis
Non-clustering
Cocktail party problem
two speaker with 2 microphone with different distance
count down 10 with the same time
algorithm to seperate 2 source of audio
to keep the first source of sound
algorithm:
[W,s,v] = svd((repmat(sum(x.*x,1),size(x,1),1).*x)*x');

With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results.
