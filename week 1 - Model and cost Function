Model representation
m = Number of reaining examples
x's = "input" variable /features
y's = "output" varible / "target" variable

(x,y) - one training example
(x(i), y(i)) - ith training example

Trainging Set -> learning algorithm -> hypothesis (from size of house to Estimated price)
h =h(x) =0 +1 x
